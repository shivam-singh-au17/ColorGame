# About The Project

### This is a personal project which I had to make on a theme so I decided to make it on the Shravasti district, Shravasti is a district of Uttar Pradesh that is known for the temples of Gautam Buddha and also known for its natural environment. I have completed my diploma from here for 3 years and I love this place so I have tried to make a small website on it so that people can know about it and my purpose for making this project is only my personal thinking and desire to improve my technical skills.

# Technologies I Used

- I used  [HTML-5](https://www.w3schools.com/html/) and [CSS-3](https://www.w3schools.com/css/default.asp) for designing and layout.
- And also used  [JavaScript](https://www.w3schools.com/javascript/) for designing and layout.

-  [Github](https://github.com/shivam-singh-au17) for functionality.
